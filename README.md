# TexasHoldEm
This being the first official MLH Hackathon attended by us, Alvie and I decided to spend all of our time learning something new. We spent a great deal of time wondering what to make until I remembered about the deck of cards the recruiters from SIG had given me. Seeing as how they use a lot of C#, we took this as a great opportunity to learn C# as well as make something that SIG really loves: **Poker**.
This is a Project developed by **Alvie Hossain and Jeremy Gouveia**.

**Let's get started,**

# But First, the Algorithm

## Getting Started
  These instructions will get you up and running with a local copy of our sweet poker game.
### Prerequisites
  As long as you have an IDE that can run .NET applications or C#, you will be able to access our information. 
  ``` We used Visual Studio code with the C# extension powered by OmniSharp which was kindly provided by Microsoft```

Properties:
Readonly = final //in Java

In creating our program, we ran into the issue of how to sort the types of hands. After an extensive amount of research and a trip to the WayBack machine, we were able to find an algorithm from a site from 2009.
Here is the algorithm we will be implementing:
