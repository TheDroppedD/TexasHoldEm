# TexasHoldEm
This being the first official MLH Hackathon attended by us, Alvie and I decided to spend all of our time learning something new. We spent a great deal of time wondering what to make until I remembered about the deck of cards the recruiters from SIG had given me. Seeing as how they use a lot of C#, we took this as a great opportunity to learn C# as well as make something that SIG really loves: **Poker**.
This is a Project developed by **Alvie Hossain and Jeremy Gouveia**.

**Let's get started:**

## But First, the Algorithm
  It took us around 7 of straight work and lots of googling to structure our program. Unfortunately, we saved the worst part for last. The thing is, in Poker there are approximately 2,598,960 possible **unique** poker hands. With this in mind, we ended up with three possibilities: either create an object-oriented solution that would run through all the possible options, or import a library that someone else had already developed, OR take a nice and healthy "*hackathon* Paul from Siemens, and Mike from Booz Allen Hamilton
## Getting Started
  These instructions will get you up and running with a local copy of our sweet poker game. 
### Prerequisites
  As long as you have an IDE that can run .NET applications or C#, you will be able to access our executable. 
  ``` We used Visual Studio code with the C# extension powered by OmniSharp which was kindly provided by Microsoft```
